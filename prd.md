1. Overview
1.1 Executive Summary
This document outlines the requirements for building a performant, server-rendered blog application using Next.js and the App Router. The primary goal of this project is to serve as a practical demonstration of proficiency in modern web development fundamentals, including Next.js architecture, TypeScript, API route handling, and responsive design with Tailwind CSS. The application will be a complete, self-contained system featuring post creation, listing, detailed viewing, and search functionality, all powered by a local JSON file for data persistence. The final product will be deployed on Vercel and documented in a public GitHub repository for evaluation.
1.2 Problem Statement
Developers learning Next.js need a well-defined, real-world project to apply and showcase their skills. A simple blog is an ideal use case, as it covers critical concepts like routing, multiple rendering strategies (SSG/SSR), data fetching, form handling, and API creation. This project addresses the need for a clear, bounded exercise that can be completed without reliance on external databases, paid services, or complex authentication systems, allowing the developer to focus purely on mastering the Next.js framework.
1.3 Goals & Objectives
Product Goals:
Deliver a seamless and intuitive user experience for reading, searching, and creating blog posts.
Provide a visually appealing and responsive interface that works flawlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
Ensure the application is fast and reliable, giving users instant access to content.
Technical Goals:
Demonstrate mastery of Next.js 13+ with the App Router, including file-based routing and component hierarchy.
Effectively implement different rendering strategies (SSG, SSR) to optimize performance for different page types.
Build and consume internal API routes for data manipulation (reading and writing to a JSON file).
Enforce strict type safety across the entire application using TypeScript.
Write clean, modular, and maintainable code that follows industry best practices.
1.4 Scope
In Scope:
Homepage: A static, performant page listing all blog posts with excerpts.
Dynamic Post Pages: Individual, statically generated pages for each blog post.
Post Creation: A client-rendered form to add new posts, which are persisted to the local data source.
API Layer: Next.js API routes to handle GET and POST requests for blog data.
Client-Side Search: Real-time filtering of blog posts on the homepage.
Responsive Design: Full adaptability for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
Deployment: The application will be deployed to Vercel.
Source Control: The complete codebase will be available in a public GitHub repository.
Out of Scope (for this version):
User authentication or author profiles.
A rich text/WYSIWYG editor for post creation.
Post editing or deletion functionality.
A comment system for posts.
Integration with any external database (SQL or NoSQL).
Pagination for the blog post list.
User-generated content other than new post creation.
1.5 User Personas
Alex, the Reader (End User): A casual visitor who wants to quickly find and read interesting articles. Alex values a fast-loading site, clean typography, and the ability to easily search for topics of interest.
Sam, the Contributor (End User): A user who wants to contribute a blog post. Sam needs a simple, straightforward form to submit their content without any friction.
Dr. Sharma, the Evaluator (Instructor): An instructor who will assess the project. Dr. Sharma is looking for evidence of technical proficiency, clean code, thoughtful architecture, and a functional final product that meets all specified requirements.
2. Functional Requirements
FR-01: Homepage - Blog Post List
Description: The application's root route (/) will serve as the homepage, displaying a reverse-chronologically sorted list of all blog posts. This page should be highly optimized for fast initial loads.
Technical Details:
This page will be rendered using Static Site Generation (SSG) at build time for maximum performance.
Data will be fetched from the data/posts.json file during the build process.
Each post preview in the list will be a self-contained component.
Acceptance Criteria:
Given a user navigates to the homepage (/).
When the page loads.
Then they see a list of all blog posts, sorted with the newest post first.
And each post in the list displays its title, author, publication date, and a content excerpt of the first 150 characters followed by "...".
And each post has a "Read More" link/button that navigates to its unique post page (e.g., /posts/1).
FR-02: Individual Blog Post Page
Description: Users can view the full content of a single blog post by navigating to a unique URL.
Technical Details:
Uses dynamic routing (/posts/[id]).
These pages will be generated at build time using SSG with generateStaticParams for all existing posts.
If a user requests a post ID that does not exist, a custom, user-friendly 404 "Not Found" page will be displayed.
Acceptance Criteria:
Given a user is on the homepage.
When they click the "Read More" link for a post with ID [id].
Then they are navigated to /posts/[id].
And the page displays the post's full title, content, author, and date.
Given a user manually enters a URL for a non-existent post (e.g., /posts/999).
When the page attempts to load.
Then a custom 404 page is rendered, with a message like "Post not found" and a link back to the homepage.
FR-03: Create a New Post
Description: A dedicated page (/create) provides a form for users to submit new blog posts.
Technical Details:
The page will contain a client-side rendered form managed by React hooks (useState).
On form submission, a POST request is sent to a Next.js API route (/api/posts) with the form data.
The API route will validate the incoming data, generate a new id and the current date, and append the new post object to posts.json.
Crucial Note: Writing to the file system is not supported in Vercel's serverless environment after deployment. The functionality will work locally. For the deployed version, new posts will be held in memory or the functionality can be demonstrated via a video/local instance. The README must explain this limitation. A better approach is to trigger a rebuild of the site via a webhook if this were a real production app, but that is out of scope.
Acceptance Criteria:
Given a user navigates to the /create page.
When they fill out the "Title", "Content", and "Author" fields and click "Submit".
Then a POST request is sent to /api/posts.
And upon a successful API response, they are redirected to the homepage (/).
And the newly created post appears at the top of the blog list.
FR-04: Search Functionality
Description: An input field on the homepage allows users to filter the list of posts in real-time based on their titles.
Technical Details:
A single search input will be present on the homepage.
Filtering logic will be implemented entirely on the client-side using React hooks (useState for the search query, useEffect or useMemo to compute the filtered list).
The search should be case-insensitive.
Acceptance Criteria:
Given the user is on the homepage with a list of posts.
When they type text into the search bar.
Then the list of posts dynamically filters to show only those whose titles contain the typed text.
And if the search input is cleared, the full list of posts is displayed again.
And if no posts match the search query, a message "No results found." is displayed.
FR-05: Bonus Features (Optional)
Sort by Date: Implement a toggle/dropdown on the homepage to sort posts by date (newest first or oldest first).
Markdown Support: Use a library like react-markdown to parse and render basic Markdown (headings, bold, italics, lists, links) in the post content on the individual post page.
Client-Side Form Validation: On the /create page, disable the submit button and show inline error messages if any of the fields are empty or do not meet minimum length requirements (e.g., title > 5 chars).
3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
Category	Requirement
Performance	• The homepage and post pages (SSG) must achieve a Google Lighthouse performance score of 90+. <br> • First Contentful Paint (FCP) should be under 1.8 seconds.
Usability & Accessibility (A11y)	• The application must be fully navigable using only a keyboard. <br> • All interactive elements must have clear focus states. <br> • Color contrast ratios must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. <br> • All images (if any) must have alt tags, and icons must have aria-labels.
Responsiveness	• The layout must be fluid and adapt gracefully to common screen sizes: Mobile (< 768px), Tablet (768px - 1024px), and Desktop (> 1024px).
Security	• All user-generated content (from the create form) submitted to the API must be sanitized on the server-side to prevent basic XSS or data corruption before being written to the JSON file.
Code Quality & Maintainability	• Code must be written in TypeScript with strict mode enabled. <br> • The project must follow a logical and modular file structure (e.g., components/, lib/, app/). <br> • Components should be small and single-purpose where possible. <br> • Code should be commented where logic is complex.

TypeScript
4.3 API Endpoints
Method	Path	Description	Success Response	Error Response
GET	/api/posts	Fetches the complete list of all blog posts.	200 OK with JSON BlogPost[]	500 Internal Server Error if file read fails.
POST	/api/posts	Creates a new blog post. The request body should contain { title, content, author }.	201 Created with the new BlogPost object.	400 Bad Request for invalid input. <br> 500 Internal Server Error if file write fails.
5. Risks and Mitigations
Risk	Likelihood	Impact	Mitigation Strategy
Data Persistence on Vercel	High	Medium	The POST functionality to write to posts.json will not work on Vercel's ephemeral file system. This limitation must be clearly documented in the README. The feature will be developed and tested locally.
Security Vulnerabilities	Medium	Medium	User input from the create form could contain malicious scripts. Sanitize all string inputs on the server-side API route before writing to the JSON file.
State Management Complexity	Low	Low	Client-side search and form state could become tangled. Adhere strictly to using simple React hooks and keep logic within the relevant components. Avoid premature optimization or complex state sharing.
Build Failures	Medium	High	An error in data fetching (getStaticProps) or params generation (generateStaticParams) can cause the entire Vercel build to fail. Implement robust try...catch blocks in all data-fetching functions and provide fallback values or clear error logs.
